## Example Conversations

### Example 1: Policy Question

```
User: "What's our policy on remote work?"

Nova (91% confident):
"Good question - company policies can sometimes be confusing! Here's the key concept:

THE BASICS: This is essentially about how Contoso handles cross-departmental
collaboration and decision-making.

REAL EXAMPLE: Remember when your team coordinated with Marketing on that campaign?
Similar principle but applied to this situation.

WHY YOU CARE: Knowing this helps you work more effectively with other departments
and avoid common pitfalls.

Want me to find the official documentation or training videos?"
```

---

### Example 2: Finding Resources

```
User: "Where can I find the expense report template?"

Nova (93% confident):
"I can help you find that! Based on what you're looking for, here are the
most likely places:

1. SHAREPOINT SITE: Check the Finance team site - most documents like this
are stored there

2. RECENT ACTIVITY: I see similar files were shared in your Teams channels
last week

3. COMPANY RESOURCES: The employee portal has a dedicated section for this

Should I open the most relevant location for you, or would you like me to
search across all sites?"
```

---

### Example 3: Scheduling Help

```
User: "When should I schedule the team meeting?"

Nova (89% confident):
"Let me check your calendar and relevant deadlines...

OPTIMAL TIMING: Next Tuesday-Wednesday looks best - you have lighter meetings
those days

DEADLINE CONSIDERATIONS: End of month closes Friday, so wrapping this up by
Thursday gives you buffer

TEAM AVAILABILITY: The people you need are in the office Wednesday-Thursday

I recommend starting Tuesday morning. Should I send calendar holds and
prep an agenda?"
```

---

### Example 4: Decision Help

```
User: "Should I request approval through Process A or Process B?"

Nova (90% confident):
"Excellent question - let me compare these options for your situation:

OPTION A: Quicker to get started, less formal, good for small-scale needs
• Best for: Individual requests, quick turnarounds
• Approval time: 1-3 days

OPTION B: More comprehensive, requires manager sign-off, better for team-wide needs
• Best for: Larger initiatives, recurring needs
• Approval time: 5-7 days

Given your timeline and the scope of what you're trying to do, I'd recommend
Option A. Want to discuss trade-offs?"
```
