# Copilot-SharePoint Integration Strategy

## Executive Summary

Corporate employees are increasingly using Copilot instead of SharePoint for discovering company information. This creates a strategic challenge: how do we meet users where they are while preserving SharePoint's value and investments?

## The Problem

**Current State:**
- Employees prefer Copilot's conversational interface for finding information
- SharePoint remains the primary platform for corporate communications
- Corporate Communications teams risk losing engagement and visibility

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **Corporate Communications Teams**: Need to reach employees effectively
- **Corporate Employees**: Want fast, easy access to company information

## Two Strategic Approaches

### Approach 1: Port SharePoint Content to Copilot

**What it means:** Bring company SharePoint sites and content directly into the Copilot experience.

**Benefits:**
- Meet users where they already are (in Copilot)
- Increase engagement with corporate content
- Provide modern, conversational experience
- Multi-channel content distribution

**Challenges:**
- Risk of cannibalizing SharePoint usage
- May misalign with SharePoint's product roadmap
- Could confuse users about where to find information
- Technical complexity in content migration and maintenance

**Best for:** Organizations ready to transition away from SharePoint as primary comms hub

### Approach 2: Embed Copilot Agents in SharePoint (Recommended)

**What it means:** Add Copilot's AI capabilities directly into SharePoint sites as an embedded agent.

**Benefits:**
- Optimizes performance of existing SharePoint investments
- Aligns with both product roadmaps
- Creates monetization opportunities through premium features
- Preserves Corporate Communications' control and platform

**Challenges:**
- Limited ability to personalize experience across tools
- Experience remains somewhat fragmented
- Licensing and access control complexity

**Best for:** Organizations wanting to enhance SharePoint while preserving its role

## Implementation Prototypes

Two prototypes demonstrate these approaches:

**Prototype 1: Copilot-First Experience**
- Dedicated Copilot interface with Contoso agent
- Agent selection sidebar
- Full chat experience
- URL: [prototype1_v5_copilot_ux.html](prototype1_v5_copilot_ux.html)

**Prototype 2: SharePoint-First Experience**
- Traditional SharePoint layout
- Floating AI assistant (FAB)
- Embedded chat capabilities
- URL: [prototype2_sharepoint_clean.html](prototype2_sharepoint_clean.html)

## Recommendation Framework

Choose **Approach 1** (Port to Copilot) if:
- Your organization is moving away from SharePoint
- Employee adoption of Copilot is very high
- You can accept potential SharePoint cannibalization
- You have resources for significant technical migration

Choose **Approach 2** (Agents in SharePoint) if:
- You want to preserve SharePoint investments
- Corporate Communications needs to maintain platform control
- You prefer iterative enhancement over wholesale change
- You want to align with Microsoft's product direction

## Next Steps

1. **Validate with stakeholders**: Gather feedback from Corporate Communications teams and employee samples
2. **Test prototypes**: Use the two prototypes to understand user preferences
3. **Assess technical feasibility**: Evaluate integration complexity and timelines
4. **Define success metrics**: Establish KPIs for engagement, satisfaction, and efficiency
5. **Plan pilot**: Start with limited scope to test chosen approach
